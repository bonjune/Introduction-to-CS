# Getting Started

Before we start, you should keep in mind that programming is not only coding, but also reading lots of documents(for details).

## Python Install Guide.

1. Download Anaconda with python3.
[Click here to download.](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. Type the same as below to check if the anaconda is installed successfully.

```
(conda) conda --version
```

3. Run Python REPL.
```
(conda) python
```

Done! It's really recommended to get familiar with Python REPL(or Python Interactive Interpreter).

## IDE Install Guide.

1. Download VSCode.
[Click here to download.](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Download Python Extension.

## Very First Tutorial

Let's have fun with Python. And get some feeling about
```
Life is short. Do Python.
```

We will write a small program recording a video. Awesome!
* Keep in mind : this program depends on some libraries(PIL, opencv).

```
(conda) conda install -c anaconda pil 
(conda) conda install -c anaconda opencv
```


# Python Basics

## Data types

We will cover data types with Python REPL.

1. Numbers
2. Strings
3. Lists and Tuples
4. Dictionaries
5. Sets
6. Booleans

## Subtopics

* How to use Shell?
* What is the difference between variable and expression?


Then we will start to write codes with Python.
VSCode is recommended. I will help you to install, and set up.

## Control Flow
1. for-loops
2. while-loops
3. if-elif-else

## Function
1. Simple structure of a function
2. Why we have to use function?
3. Writing GOOD code
