# Getting Started

Befor we get started, please be sure to keep in mind that programming not only includes coding, but also does reading lots documents with details.

## Python Install Guide.

1. Download Anaconda for python3.
[Click here to download.](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. Open Anaconda prompt.
3. Type the command same as below to check if the anaconda is installed successfully.

```
(conda) conda --version
```

4. Run Python REPL.
```
(conda) python
```

Done! It's really recommended to get familiar with Python REPL(or Python Interactive Interpreter).

## IDE Install Guide.

1. Download VSCode.
[Click here to download.](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Download Python Extension.

## Very First Tutorial

Let's have fun with Python. And get some feeling about
```
Life is short. Do Python.
```

We will write a small program recording a video. Awesome!
* Keep in mind : this program depends on some libraries(PIL, opencv).

```
(conda) conda install -c anaconda pil 
(conda) conda install -c anaconda opencv
```


# Python Basics

## Data types

We will cover data types with Python REPL.

1. **Numbers**
* Assignment
* Arithmetic Operation
* Operator Priority

2. **Strings**
* Representation
* String Operation
* Indexing
* Slicing
* Formatting
* Methods

3. **Lists and Tuples**
* Representation
* List Operation
* Indexing
* Slicing
* Methods
* Difference between List and Tuples

4. **Dictionaries**
* Representation
* Key-Value Pair
* Methods

5. **Sets**
* Representation
* What is Set(mathematically)?
* Methods

6. **Booleans**
* True and False
* Boolean Features of Data
* Boolean Operation

Then we will start to write codes with Python.

## Control Flow
1. for-loops
2. while-loops
3. if-elif-else

## Function
1. Simple structure of a function
2. Why we have to use function?
3. Writing GOOD code

## Subtopics

* How to use Shell?  
    basic commands: cd, ls, mkdir
* How to use git and GitHub?  
    IMPORTANT! I will share code with you in GitHub. Emails are for conversation, not coding.
* What is the difference between variables and expressions?
